# B-Vehicular-Framework
This is framework for making applications pertaining to Vehicular communication and location. 
It includes a version of RSSICalculator but like any open-source frame, it is completely changeable but not at the risk of authors. 
It has been tested rigourously at our end, but we do not maintain any changes in the core. 

Major interest are applications, datascience and vehicular localization and applications based on it. 

If you use it anywhere, do let us know.
